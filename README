DESCRIPTION

Utility pwkickstart generates kickstart passwords from password input and
prints them to standard output in three different formats: md5, sha256 and
sha512.

Previously grub-crypt provided the same, but it is not longer available in
some Linux distributions.

The output in section was shortened to fit on screen in the SYNOPOSIS example
above.
